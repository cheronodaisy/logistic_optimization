# Logistic Optimization: Unfulfilled Orders Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to determine the causes of unfulfilled orders at Gokada using causal inference methods. By conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, we can prepare the data for effective downstream analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- 
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cheronodaisy/logistic-optimization.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd logistic-optimization
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provides insights and intuition into the data, ensuring proper data cleaning and preparation for further analysis. It includes:
- Data visualization
- Summary statistics
- Identification of missing values and outliers

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating additional variables to enrich the data, which can help improve the performance of machine learning models. It includes;
- Creating new features from existing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing or scaling numerical features
